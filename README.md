# ANN-forest-fire-burn-area-detection
Predict the Burned Area of Forest Fires with Neural Networks
This GitHub project aims to predict the burned area of forest fires using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
The solution was implemented and tested in a Jupyter Notebook, achieving an accuracy of 98%.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the ForestFires.csv This dataset contains information about forest fires in the Montesinho natural park, Portugal. 
It includes 517 instances and 31 attributes, such as temperature, humidity, wind, and rain.

## Solution
The solution to this problem was implemented using ANNs, which are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
The ANN used in this project is a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer, which was trained using backpropagation.

The Jupyter Notebook contains the code used for data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. 
The model was evaluated using cross-validation and the accuracy metric. 
Finally, the notebook includes a section with some visualizations to help understand the data and the results.

## Usage
To use this project, simply download or clone the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook file. Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Keras.

 ## Conclusion
The results of this project demonstrate that ANNs can be an effective solution for predicting the burned area of forest fires. With an accuracy of 98%, this model could be useful for predicting the impact of forest fires and helping authorities take preventive measures to reduce their effects.
